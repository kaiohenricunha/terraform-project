# 1 - AWS Regions and AZs

- AWS Regions are separate geographic areas that AWS uses to house its infrastructure. These are distributed around the world so that customers can choose a region closest to them in order to host their cloud infrastructure there. The closer your region is to you, the better, so that you can reduce network latency as much as possible for your end-users. You want to be near the data centers for fast service.

- Not all regions are created equally. These regions have more services than others in their general areas:
    - Americas: US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California)
    - Asia Pacific:  Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo
    - EU: Frankfurt, Ireland

- AZs are basically isolated locations— data centers — within a region. Important for resiliency.
